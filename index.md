## Welcome To Brenden's Website!

This website will include a brief description of who I am and what I like to do!

### Background

I was born in Moscow Idaho on _August 3rd, 2000._ Since then, I have lived in **Boise**, **Seattle**, and **Weiser** respectively. Spending most of my time and k-12 schooling in [Weiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weiser,_Idaho), a small farming town northwest of Boise, I learned what life on the farm was like. ![weiser](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Weiser_ID_-_aerial.jpg/1920px-Weiser_ID_-_aerial.jpg) We raised animals and alfalfa to sell, and I would help our field produce more alfalfa by trapping gophers. I trapped well over 2000 gophers over the course of 8 years and made money doing so. I would make $3 total per gopher caught, and this was counted by the number of tails I could present to my father and the county weed board. My father would give me $2 and the weed board would give me the remaining $1. As I progressed through public school, I began to take an interest in computers and their capabilities. I loved how astoundingly mysterious they were; I had absolutely no clue how people could make electronics so small and smart so that they could produce legible images on a screen for my consumption. I began some self research into the topic of computer science by watching video tutorials on youtube and learning the basics of csharp. Once I learned that computer science classes were offered in high school, I immediately registered for them. I have been hooked on computer science since then, and I hope it continues to keep me interested throughout the rest of my career.
